# VIDEO WALK THROUGH
[Go To ALABAMAZON!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQrqWTIJ8V88o5sW6bZLgx_thzCRBB4G/view).

## Description
ALABAMAZON is the place to go to buy the stuff you need in Alabama, y'all.
* Y'all gonna need to look at the screenshots, because Homer Jenkins told us we wasn't gonna have no online backend database.
* Now don't get me wrong y'hear - this here app has done been hooked up to a MYSQL database on my system, and I created a Table that has all the stuff that's done gonna be sold.  Each one a-them items has a unique id, name, department, price and quantity. I was gonna put in color options, but Maw Maw was callin' us in fer dinner so I had to cut off afore she punched me in the eye for bein' late to the table. 
* ALABAMAZON uses that there MYSQL.  No, not the sequel to "Dukes of Hazzard"
* ALABAMAZON got itself all hitched up with inquirer.  No, not the National Inquirer, that makes about as much sense as chewin' the tail off a hog
* ALABAMAZON also uses Node.js, because iffen it didn't, then the whole thing would go off the rails and hit a cedar tree in Poke Robertson's back field.  
* Now what you gotta do, assumin' you've avoided my guard cow and managed to bust into my laptop, is fire up the app using Node.  I knowed you knowed that.  Then you can play around buyin' all the stuff you know you really need.  ALABAMAZON can show you what's available, and acts like one of them silly little eCommerce sites like Amazon in that you can ask it questions and what not.  

## Motivation
Well, I wouldn't slap you in the face with a catfish to avoid bein' a liar, so I'll just say it up front.  I had to do this hear app because my bootcamp says I have to do it or they'll take me out into the town square and flog me in public.  I don't want that to happen again. 

## Results
It looks better than a sharp stick in the eye.

## Team Efforts
* layout - ME
* coding - ME
* Gittin' the hub - ME
* Everything else - ME

### Challenges
I was surely regrettin' that I waited so long to complete this homework.  I wish it'd be as easy to remember node.js and MYSQL as it is to remember all the 9,785 types of blue tick hounds, but it 't'ain't.  So it took me whut felt like about 87 years to do this. 

## Improvements
* I think I'd like to put indoor plumbing in the house.
* Mebbe I kin figure out more stuff to sell
* YEEE HAWW BOOT CAMP!! ROLL CODE!!
